    <h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Unlike traditional programming, where explicit instructions are provided, ML enables systems to automatically learn patterns from data and improve their performance over time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>There are three main types of machine learning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the output (or target) is already known. The system learns from this data to predict the output for new, unseen data.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given data without labels and must find patterns or groupings in the data on its own. This is useful for tasks like clustering and dimensionality reduction.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Reinforcement learning is based on an agent that learns by interacting with its environment. It gets feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and uses this feedback to make better decisions in the future.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Applications of Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>Machine learning is widely used in various fields, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Healthcare:</span> Predicting disease outbreaks, diagnosing conditions, and personalizing treatment plans.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Finance:</span> Fraud detection, risk analysis, and algorithmic trading.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Transportation:</span> Self-driving cars, route optimization, and predictive maintenance.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Retail:</span> Product recommendations, inventory management, and customer behavior analysis.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Machine learning is a powerful tool that is revolutionizing industries and how businesses operate. By utilizing large datasets and advanced algorithms, it allows systems to make data-driven decisions that were previously unimaginable.</p>
